# UrbanSim: A set of functions for supporting Agent-Based Models employing street networks

It extends some functions of GeoMason and Jts, in particular graph related.
It furthermore consists in sets of functions for the extraction of OD pairs for simulation models, and angles' computations. 


It requires:
